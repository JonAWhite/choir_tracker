Hi All - Here are the song suggestions for Sunday.  As it is the 3rd Sunday
of the month, we will have rehearsal immediately following service.  We
will be rehearsing a new song (H564 Come as a child) to sing for the
Celia's baptism next Sunday.

Thanks, so much for all you do!

Hi All - I got a text from Noel that he left his windbreaker at church
tonight.  I asked him if he wanted to pick it up at our next rehearsal, or
I'd meet him at church any time to get it, or whether we should hold it
hostage for him to come sing with us on Sunday.

His reply:

*"If everyone else will be there, I will come and sing on Sunday.  But only
if we have a run-through before the service.*
*Deal?"*

*Is everyone willing to come early - ready to sing at 9:40 am - to run
through the songs for service?*

Please let me know by noon on Saturday so I can get back to Noel one way or
another.

Thanks for your prompt response!
Barb

Hi All - Sorry I have not gotten back to you.  Our sopranos will be absent
tomorrow!  So - if it will work out for you to come early, at 9:40 to
practice, we can see how it goes with me and/or Betsy on soprano.  If you
cannot make it, or it doesn't work out, I have another song that the choir
can sing after the text (#8 in the choir book - verse 2 of Give me a heart
like Thine).  Please reply to all to confirm that you got this message and

when I sent out the original email I was actually thinking that the best
option would likely be to have two or three sopranos on this song! thanks!

Definitely the first rehearsal - and maybe the second.  He used it to get a
feel for how we sing.

HI Jon - Here's the songs for Sunday. Thanks, so very much for doing this!
It is the 1st Sunday so there is rehearsal, as well.

For rehearsal could you please:
* Ask the Ev and DEv to please say hello in the back after the video and
the discussion.  That would really aid the rehearsal to get started sooner
- especially as there is the video and the discussion this Sunday
* In rehearsal please review:  Ave Verum Corpus; #128 in the choir book;
Praise is Rising sheet music.  And anything else you'd like to cover.
* Please let the choir know that the Mozart will not be sung until the 17th
or 24th as Simone will not be in White Plains to play on the 10th.
* Remind the choir that our next rehearsal with Noel is Monday 25 April.

Thanks, again Jon!  Have an amazing day in White Plains.  Jason - enjoy the
confirmation in New Milford!
Barb

Hi Jason -

I'm out of town as well.

Jon - will you be around?  If it would help at all I can pick songs for the
day.  Let me know.  If you aren't around then I'll reach out to Simone or
Pr. Henkel, who both have filled in to direct in the past.

Thanks!  Barb

Hi All -

I'm so sorry that the flu has taken it's toll in White Plains.  I hope
everyone is feeling better soon!

With all the sickness, the Good Friday song list ended up with
last-minute-revamping.  We did more congregational singing and did NOT sing
Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus.

If it works out, and everyone is healthy and feels up to it, we will sing
the Mozart tomorrow for Easter for repentance.  Please note, this is NOT a
call for anyone to overextend themselves or hurt their voice or to try
anything super-heroic!  If it works out - that's a wonderful thing.  If it
does not work out, then we will sing it in the next couple of weeks - the
3rd or 10th of April.

Everyone - choir and organists alike - worked very, very hard on the
Passion Week songs.  And we sound very, very good.  It can be disappointing
when we've worked so hard on something and circumstances and plans change.
I want to assure everyone that we WILL sing the Mozart, either tomorrow or
in the next few weeks when it works out for everyone.  None of our
rehearsing is in vain, as we carry all our learning through to every song
that we sing.

And one more reminder - that EVERYONE is invited to sing in the choir -
whether it's once a month or once a year or every service!

Thanks, so much, for all you do!  Stay healthy!  💒
Barb

hi jon!  soooooo very sorry that you're not feeling well!  thanks for
letting me know. it appears that most of the choir has been hit!  pr
henkel, jason, dorothea, you. I doubt that we will be singing ave verum
corpus. I will likely switch many of the songs out and do more
congregational songs.  hope you feel better!  barb

Hi All - Here are the song suggestions for Easter Sunday.  They have not
changed since being sent out on 6 March.  Please take a few moments to
review any songs that were not rehearsed on Saturday or Sunday.

Thanks, so much.  Have an amazing rest of the week!

Hi All – Sorry for the length of the message.  Just a reminder that we have
rehearsal with Noel *TOMORROW – Saturday 19 March – at 6pm*.  We will be
practicing the songs for Passion week.  There are a number of songs we
haven’t sung in a while.  Because I won't be there, I’ve included the list
I’d like to rehearse with Noel – in order of importance – and we will not
get through all of them in rehearsal.  So please, please take some extra
time to review the songs.



Jason – I included the Palm Sunday songs I thought might need to be
reviewed – but feel free to add in or change what you thing is pertinent.



Here’s what I’d like to rehearse with Noel in order of importance (PS=Palm
Sunday, GF=Good Friday, E=Easter):

*PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO RECORD THE REHEARSAL - especially the exercises at
the beginning!*  I use a free downloadable app on my phone, which works
very well.  It's called 'Hi-Q MP3 Recorder'

*Rehearsal List:*
#1 - DON'T FORGET TO RECORD THE REHEARSAL
Sheet Music – Praise is rising – PS

Sheet Music - Ave verum corpus - GF

H518 – See what a morning - E

128 – How can I forget - GF

C302 – Lamb of God - GF

H501/C315 – Were you there - GF

C300 – All glory, laud and honor - PS

C12 – Praise Him!  Praise Him! - PS

H486/C297 – Hosanna, loud hosanna - PS

C320 – Beneath the cross of Jesus - GF

H92 – In Christ alone - E

H466 – Holy Spirit, living Breath of God – E

H409 – Gath’ring homeward, you pilgrims – PS

H466 – Holy Spirit, living Breath of God – PS

H461 – Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit - PS



Also – if Noel has extra time at rehearsal end, please work on the
solo/quartets:

H317 – O Mighty Cross – Soprano, Erika, Jon, John (I was going to sing this
but I’m OK if someone else wants to step in)

H503/C3324 – When I survey the wondrous cross – Erica, John

H499 – There is a green hill far away - John





Here are the individual service song lists, which I were sent a few weeks
ago:

Hi all - Thanks so much for your hard work in rehearsal.  As we will not be
rehearsing again until the 19th - which will be our March rehearsal with
Noel - I wanted to give you the songs that will likely be sung for each
service in Passion week - subject to change!

Please note: We have NOT reviewed all of the songs below!  Take some time
to look through them and make sure we won't find any surprises popping out
at us while we are singing them!

Thanks!

Thanks, Jason!  I'll get the Palm Sunday songs to you this weekend.
Thanks, again for jumping in to direct Palm Sunday.  I really appreciate it.

Let me know if you were thinking of anything in particular for Easter.  If
not, no worries, I'll put a list together.

Thanks, again!

Hi All - just a reminder that we have rehearsal with Noel tomorrow night.
We will be practicing our new songs for Palm Sunday and Good Friday -
specifically the Mozart piece 'Ave Verum Corpus' and the new 'Praise is

Hi Simone - I'm sorry I just saw your email this morning.

Is the hymn a tune that we would recognize?  I'm asking because I find that
prior to service instrumentals with new, unfamiliar melodies are great.
And for contemplative parts mid-service, an unfamiliar melody can be more
of a distraction than a help in contemplating.  In those cases, familiar is
much more comforting and conducive to contemplation.

Apostle Fendt replied to my email about song suggestions that we will need
a song to prepare for Holy Communion for the departed, which I didn't
include in the list, and prefer a vocal piece for that because the piece
after Communion for the departed is instrumental.

Would your piece work for after Communion for the departed?  If it's
familiar, then 2:45 min would be a bit long but still doable.  If it's not
familiar, then 2:45 may seem like hours.  Kind of like when you're driving
somewhere for the very first time on unfamiliar roads and it seems like
you'll never get there, but on the way back, because you've already made
the trip and know what to expect, it seems way quicker - even though it's
the same distance and same amount of time.

We could use your piece during congregational Communion, then maybe a piano
piece after.

We could take out one of the choir songs before service (maybe 'Near to the
heart of God') and have your piece right before service - and then use
'Near to the heart of God' before Communion for the departed.  Maybe with
the small group of us that rehearsed it with Noel (Betsy, Diana, Jon, John,
you and me).  Or just drop the song and have a solo, duet, quartet piece -
Like C461 - "In remembrance of Me".

Thoughts, anyone?  None of this is set in stone.

Thanks!  Barb

Hi all -  Here are all the recordings of our sessions with Noel. Thanks,
Jon for doing this.

In our session on Monday, we spent time re-learning how to sing old, OLD
songs that have been sung for more than half a century.

As always, a good time was had by all!

Thanks!

These are some of the songs for us to go through over the next 6 months'

Thanks, Jon - What is your opinion on singing it in Latin?  It really isn't
that hard to sing phonetically.  I have a few different translations
(thanks for supplying yours!) and any one of them would be a bit awkward
"fitting" the English text to the music - but we can absolutely do it if we
think it's the better way to go.  I don't feel that the "Lead us Heavenly
Father" words are nearly as appropriate for passion week.  Thanks!  Barb

Hi all - I'm looking for your input, please.

Palm Sunday is always a difficult service to find songs for because the
focus of Passion week is Good Friday and Easter.

So I've been searching for contemporary "Hosanna" songs and I've found one
that I'd like your opinion on.

PLEASE disregard the way the song is sung - very "sweet" and "cute" - and
really unlike what Noel is teaching us.

The recordings have full orchestration and we would do them with just a
piano accompaniment.

The first is a shorter version and sung very "choral-y".  The second is
sung in a style more in line with the lyrics (though both still sound
"sweet!"), and is quite long, and I'd likely cut some of it out.

Again, please let me know your thoughts.  Click on (or cut and paste)  each
link, then click on the "LISTEN" button.

Version 1: (Vicky Tucker Courtney arrangement)

http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/hosanna-praise-is-rising-sheet-music/19831527

Version 2: (Richard Kingsmore arrangement):

http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/hosanna-praise-is-rising-sheet-music/16557262

And if you have any other suggestions for Palm Sunday songs - I'm all
ears!  I'm looking at a few different versions of Holy! Holy! Holy!

For Good Friday it is very likely we will do Mozart's "Ave Verum Copus"
(we've sung it as "Lead Us Heavenly Father").  What are your thoughts about
singing it in Latin and displaying an English version of the words (which
are NOT "Lead us Heavenly Father!") on the monitor?  It is a classical
piece written in Latin - but is singing it in Latin too Catholic for us at
this time?

Thanks,

Thanks, Jon.  I'm re-working the schedule now, which will need to be
checked against your "availability" list. I'd like to direct this Sunday
because I can't wait until the 31st to do my first directing.  I'll get
back to you with the re-scheduled list hopefully tonight.  Thanks!  Barb

Hi All - Here are the songs for Christmas morning.

I haven't heard back from anyone regarding solos/duets/quartets - so if you
have worked on something, we will definitely fit it in.

If you remember (among all the other things to do!) please try to do a few
breathing exercise on your way to service.  Have an amazing day!  Barb

Hi All -

Here are the songs for Sunday 6 December.  We will have a brief rehearsal
after service to review a few of the songs that we will practice with Noel
next Monday 14 December.

And a reminder - if anyone would like to do a solo or small group/duet or
instrumental during this Advent and Christmas season, please let me know
what you're thinking about doing and for what service.

Thanks!
Barb

Hi All -

Just wanted to confirm with everyone the rehearsal plan for the rest of the
year.

*Sunday 6 December*:  This coming Sunday we will have a very
abbreviated version of our regularly scheduled rehearsal (1st and 3rd
Sundays of the month) immediately following service.  This is to review a
few Christmas songs so we can rehearse them with Noel the following Monday.

*Monday 14 December*:  Noel will be with us to work on Christmas songs.

*Sunday 3 or 10 January:*  Our next rehearsal after that will be either the
3rd or 10th of January - which, rather than a singing rehearsal, will be a
discussion around moving forward and getting your input for our plans for
the New Year. Please let me know which one of those Sundays will work
better for you.

Thank you all for all you do!
Barb

When the Ev asked about the availability on that date I reminded him that
we had rehearsal that day.  He didn't want to change the date of the
meeting and asked that we have a "short" rehearsal.  I'd like to review a
couple of songs so we have the notes down when we meet with Noel on
December 14th.  So we will still rehearsl.

Hi All -

I'm looking forward to having and sharing a wonderful Thanksgiving
experience with everyone tomorrow.

Next weekend - Sunday 29 November - is the first Sunday of Advent as well
as our Worship service.  We will be singing new songs for the worship
service, which have only been rehearsed once, with Noel.

To make sure all are familiar with the new worship songs, *we will have
rehearsal tomorrow - 22 November - after service.*  We will then go back to
our regular schedule, with Sunday December 6th being the next rehearsal
after tomorrow.

Thanks, so much.  See you all tomorrow!
Barb

Hi Jason - Great song list!  One song I don't think we know is H100.  I
know it because it was in the old choir book and we sang it in Buffalo (and
I think it used to be in the key of E major - with 4 sharps - if I recall
correctly).  And in the 15 years I've been in White Plains I don't recall
singing it - but I certainly haven't been in every service here.

Thoughts from our organists and directors?  Do you know this one, or are
you familiar with it?

Thanks, Barb

Hey Jason - There's actually 4 different songs in the Celebration hymnal
using that same Haydn melody.  We've never used them because they are the
same as (and excuse my spelling here) "Duetchland, Duetchland Uber Alles" -
used by the Germans during Hitler's time.  When we first got the
Celebration hymnal and I was going to practice one of them maybe 7 or so
years ago, Simone was pretty upset.

Things and attitudes may have changed since then.  So would you please
reach out to Simone and get her take on it?  See if she's OK with it?  If
not, then I would HIGHLY advise against using it.

Thanks!  Barb

Hi Jason - When you send out the songs for Sunday, could you please mention
that we will NOT have rehearsal after service, but will have rehearsal on
Monday, 18 November, at 7pm with Noel.  We'd like to work on the songs for
the Advent program unless there is something specific that you need to work
on for Thanksgiving Sunday.

I'm thinking we should ask for a special rehearsal if we need it to
accommodate all the things coming up.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
Barb

Hi Jon - so sorry this took so long.  Here's the songs I've put together
for tomorrow.  Let me know if there's anything that you're not OK with and
I'll find something else. If you're OK then I'll send them off to the list
- or you can send them.  I have no preference.

Thanks!

Hope you are having a wonderful week.  Here are the song suggestions for
Sunday.  There is no rehearsal this week - and I wouldn't be disappointed

morning to see you acting crazing in your car! 😂

See you Sunday morning.  We will start singing at 10:15.

Hi All -

This Sunday, 4 October, marks our first* after-service rehearsal*.  Please
do not show up before service to rehearse!  You will be very lonely!  For
those that may have missed it, at the bottom of this email I've included
Jason's note from last week regarding the new rehearsal schedule and format.

At rehearsals, I'm very excited to say we'll start preparing for Service
for the Departed, Thanksgiving, Christmas and our Worship Service in
November.

Here are the songs for Sunday's service. ALL are welcome and invited to
sing!

Last week's note regarding rehearsals:
Dear Choir,

Thank you all for your efforts last week, singing and rehearsing.  For
those that were not able to stay for the rehearsal, it was very
constructive and here are some of the highlights:

   - *Future rehearsals will be held after service for approx. 30 minutes
   on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.*  That means no rehearsal this
   Sunday and no more early mornings!  Sleep in, enjoy your coffee (w/o milk
   per Barb's instruction), and eat some breakfast!
   - *Attending rehearsal is not mandatory in order to sing in the choir or
   to "sing that day"!*  I know some of us are still under this
   impression.  Obviously, as the "directors",  we encourage you to attend
   because this is when we get to learn and practice the cool new songs with
   the awesome words...but it's no longer mandatory (and hasn't been for
   sometime).  If you happen to get caught in the choir, and you don't know a
   song, just fake it till you make it!
   - *Please extend the invitation to all of those that would like to sing.
    *Whether you'd like to sing every service, once in a while, or when
   you're in the mood; just show up.  Black and White is not required (but
   Mary and Jon are)!  If you only have time for a special song once in a
   while, share this with one of the directors (Barb, D. White, or myself) and
   we will be more than happy to schedule you in!
   - *If you REALLY want to learn how to sing, join us for one of the
   rehearsals with a  real vocal coach! *We've been enjoying an awesome
   opportunity to learn from a real vocal coach that has been showing up in
   our week night rehearsals for the past couple of months.  For those that
   want to learn how to sing, or for those that think they know how to sing
   (like me), show up to one or all of the remaining rehearsals from 7-9 PM on
   the following Mondays: Sept/28, Oct/26, Nov/16, and Dec/14.  Don't worry
   about showing up late or having to leave early.  Bring a friend if you'd
   like, it's starting to get cold and dark at night!

More formal announcements will be made but there's a sneak peek.

Thanks!
Barb

hi jason -

i just played thru the songs.  i just now asked betsy to play the lords
prayer and i'm waiting to hear back from her.  it's unison so we should be
fine with her playing.

we don't know cel 734 - though it's a nice one and we should add it to our
list for a sunday rehearsal

fyi 142 thy will be done is on the list twice - once pre svc and once
text/mid svc

i probably won't play for 142 and c690 - they are oldies that will likely
sound better a capella (not sure how to spell that!) - but i'll be ready to
jump in if needed

Jason - great message - very upbeat and enthusiastic.  I was kind of
waiting until Pr. Henkel had his congregational talk - but it's OK to go
ahead and include the message.

There's no requirement/need to have a song for Monday.  I just wanted you
both to know that if you happen to have one, then great, we'll use it.

Jon - I really like the email invite for rehearsals.  It's a great idea.
Please go ahead and send it out whenever you're ready to do it.

Thank you both for all you do!
Barb

yes that is part of the plan - for him to help us get ready for
thanksgiving and christmas.  this monday we'll be looking at a new song
that betsy found for our worship service at the end of november.

if there's anything specific you're thinking abt just chime in and we'll
incorporate it.

noel is a bit jealous of our choir.  he has only one lead soprano in his

thinks we have the talent (and i agree) to tackle bigger stuff.

so bring on the suggestions!

Your grandmother would be SO proud of these music choices!  :-)

C605 is new, and rehearsal is not until after service, so not sure that it
will go so well.

You are SUCH a brave soul to sing all these oldies in one service!  lol!
Be prepared for them to sing them however they have sung them in the past
and usually that means pretty slowly.  If there are only a few ppl it
usually sounds much better.  Have fun!  Barb

good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.  In those days
when you pray, I will listen.  If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will
find me.'
 ~ Jeremiah 29:11-13 – New Living Translation
Hi Simone - I reached out to Bobby three weeks ago and a number of times
since then and he has not yet gotten back to me.  So I have no idea if he's
taking care of the music or not.  So just in case, I am in the process of
picking out songs now and will send them to you  tonight - though it will
be quite late (or shall I say early Saturday?)  At this point I am also
planning on bringing my keyboard just in case.  I really have no idea
what's going on and what the plans are - so like I said, I'm trying to be
prepared just in case.  I really appreciate you offering to fill in and
unfortunately I have no way of knowing before hand  whether or not that
will be needed!  If I do hear anything, I will be sure to let you know.
Thanks, so much!  Barb

hi jason -- you should be ok with most all of these songs.  there may be
timing issues with angry words and they do tend to sing the old ones in

Jason thanks so much for the reminder.  I am on the schedule.  I thought I
had made arrangements to switch out with someone and apparently I did not.

Jon - I'm in Rochester and will not be able to direct.  Will you be able to
jump in for me?  I picked out songs and sent them out to the choir members
a few minutes ago.  Heidi is scheduled to play and I do not know her
situation currently as to whether or not she will be able to make it to
service.  If you are feeling brave, you can also add #264 "If God be for
us" to the list for this morning.  We have not sung it in a long time and
will not be having rehearsal to run through it.  So it is entirely up to
you.  And please feel free to swap out any songs that do not resonate with
you for this service.

I hope you all have an amazing time with Bishop Schmidt!

Hi All - Here are the song suggestions for Sunday 12 Juiy.  My sincere
apologies as I thought I had made arrangements to have someone else direct
in my place for today.  I am in Rochester celebrating my sister's
birthday.  Thank you, Jason, for inquiring about the song list and
prompting me to look at the schedule and get a list of songs out to
everyone.
We are on summer hiatus and will not have rehearsals again until after
Labor Day in September.  In September we will start rhearsing for our
Worship Evening in November as well as have monthly rehearsals with Noel.

Have a wonderful, amazing morning with Bishop Schmidt!

Hi all - Here are the songs for Sunday's service.

*We will be standing in different configurations to sing the songs before
service, as well as for the songs during service.  Rehearsal will start
promptly at 9:30.  **Please be at church by 9:25 so that we can get the
logistics figured out and get comfortable with the new configurations.*

*Please also take some time to re-listen to the recordings of the
rehearsals we had with Noel.  That will go a very long way in preparing us
to sing our very best for our loved ones in eternity.*

See you at 9:25 Sunday morning - ready to go!  This is our last rehearsal
for the summer.  Our next rehearsal will be after Labor Day on 13 September.
Barb

*Songs:*
*Pre1:*  H2 - v1,4 - All creatures of our God and King
*Pre2:*  H329 - Jesus what a Friend for sinners
*Pre3:*  H301 - See who's standing at your door
*Pre4:*  Sheet music - Thy word is a lamp

*Open:*  H401 - Where charity and love prevail
*Text:    * 128 - How can I forget?
*Mid1:*   H158 v3 - The time of grace redeem today

Hi all - here are the likely songs for Deacon Rush's funeral tomorrow - 30
June at 7pm.  We will start singing around 6:30 with who ever is there at
that time.  Black and white is not necessary.  All are invited to sing.
Thanks, so much!  Barb

tomorrow's transmission service.  You'll only have to play for Repentance
and then a couple of songs for Communion.  And if we're done with all that
before the allotted time, likely play a few extra verses.

Thanks!

Hi Jon - Could you please reach out to Heidi regarding the organ schedule?
She didn't realize she was scheduled for tomorrow and she is asking to
temporarily be removed while she takes care of her mother.  I told her not
to worry about organ or choir but I'm also realizing I didn't ask how long
"temporarily" was.  See the emails below.  So sorry about having to
rearrange the schedule!  Barb

OK - No worries!  Please don't think about choir or organ.  Please come and
sing whenever you can and whenever it makes sense for you - regardless of
whether or not you can make a rehearsal.  Sending you lots of love and
prayers.  Barb

Here's the list of songs from Jason/New Milford:

Pre1:  H147 - Pass it on
Pre2:  H 70 - We Praise Thee Lord
Pre3:  H133 - Here I am, Lord
Pre4:  H104 - Praise I will praise You, Lord

Open:
H176 - Commit your way, confiding
or
H276 - Come to the Savior

Text:  H 92:   In Christ alone
Mid1: C583:  You are my all in all
Mid2: H 24:  Open our eyes Lord

Repentance: H274:  Come near you are invited
Communion: H371:  How blessed and glorious with Jesus

Close:  H 62:  Thank ye the Lord

Hi Simone

Here are the songs for tomorrow's service - a bit different from the list I
sent you this morning.  Please let me know if there are any at issue and I
will swap them out.

All - In tomorrow's rehearsal, we will also look at the song we will sing
for Noel on Monday evening.  For those of you with access to a
printer, please print out a copy of the song (My Shepherd will supply my
needs) sent in an earlier email and bring it along to rehearsal.

Thanks!

Hi All - I'm looking for suggestions for a few songs we can use for
rehearsl with Noel.  Here's what we need:

1.  One or two that we know very well and are very comfortable and familar
with.  We'll need to sing for about 10 minutes - so I'm looking for at
least 2 song suggestions.  (And of course the first one that jumped into my
head was "50B"! lol! )

2.  A song that we do NOT know that we can start working on.  It can be a
big dramatic song from the "printable online section" of musiccompanion.org
or even some sheet music you love.  What I'm looking for is something
that we don't know, will love to learn and sing but that will take time and
a bit of effort to learn.

I have some ideas and would like to hear yours as well. I'm going to go
home and take a look at my "wish-list" of songs.  Please let me know what
songs you just love and want to learn.

Jon - we will definitely need to video the session.  I'm really getting
excited!  This will be great and FUN!

Thanks!
Barb

Hi All -

Here are the songs for Sunday 26 April.

learning evening.

See you all Sunday morning at 9:30 for rehearsal. Thanks, so much, for all
you do!  Barb

Thanks Barb for setting all of this up.  We should be in good shape for the
next week.  I've gone through the songs and split them up into two groups,
songs we need to rehearse tonight with Noel, and songs we can rehearse
tomorrow after service on our own.  Yes, that is a reminder that tomorrow
is the 3rd Sunday of the month and we will have a quick rehearsal to review
some of the songs for Good Friday and Easter.  Solo's can be rehearsed
after as well.

Thanks and see you all soon.

Jason

Following Gods Law, word and command...and also assuming that he will help
us do this.

Lol, oh no!  Want me to help?  I can read through it and make some suggestions. Also, ask the evangelist if the Apostle is actually going to be using this?  In general, for visits from "dignitaries", we were told before service to sing hymns of joy, worship and praise. A DSG or Sprit openess hymn for after text and COB, and the rest is a celebration. I'll read through quick and pass along anything that comes to mind. If I knew the apostle was going to be there, I wouldn't have planned the night away!

Hi Everyone,

I just heard from Evangelist that Service has been cancelled for tomorrow.
Have a safe weekend!

Yes, die hard singers, you can still start sininging at 10:15 tomorrow
morning from the comfort of your own home.  Keep in mind, we were going to
sing "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" using the traditional kids
melody, not the one printed in the book.  Hope all goes well!

Jason

When we first got the Celebration hymnal and I was going to practice one of them maybe 7 or so years ago, Simone was pretty upset.

Hi Barb,
No problem, I'll send the note out.  Do you think we can go over C796
quickly on Monday?  It's a "familiar" tune but I don't believe anyone has
sung it before.
Thanks,
Jason

Black and White is not required (but Mary and Jon are)!  If you only have time for a special song once in a while, share this with one of the directors (Barb, D. White, or myself) and we will be more than happy to schedule you in!
>> If you REALLY want to learn how to sing, join us for one of the rehearsals with a  real vocal coach! We've been enjoying an awesome opportunity to learn from a real vocal coach that has been showing up in our week night rehearsals for the past couple of months.  For those that want to learn how to sing, or for those that think they know how to sing (like me), show up to one or all of the remaining rehearsals from 7-9 PM on the following Mondays: Sept/28, Oct/26, Nov/16, and Dec/14.  Don't worry about showing up late or having to leave early.  Bring a friend if you'd like, it's starting to get cold and dark at night!

Dear Choir,

Thank you all for your efforts last week, singing and rehearsing.  For
those that were not able to stay for the rehearsal, it was very
constructive and here are some of the highlights:

   - *Future rehearsals will be held after service for approx. 30 minutes
   on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.*  That means no rehearsal this
   Sunday and no more early mornings!  Sleep in, enjoy your coffee (w/o milk
   per Barb's instruction), and eat some breakfast!
   - *Attending rehearsal is not mandatory in order to sing in the choir or
   to "sing that day"!*  I know some of us are still under this
   impression.  Obviously, as the "directors",  we encourage you to attend
   because this is when we get to learn and practice the cool new songs with
   the awesome words...but it's no longer mandatory (and hasn't been for
   sometime).  If you happen to get caught in the choir, and you don't know a
   song, just fake it till you make it!
   - *Please extend the invitation to all of those that would like to sing.
    *Whether you'd like to sing every service, once in a while, or when
   you're in the mood; just show up.  Black and White is not required (but
   Mary and Jon are)!  If you only have time for a special song once in a
   while, share this with one of the directors (Barb, D. White, or myself) and
   we will be more than happy to schedule you in!
   - *If you REALLY want to learn how to sing, join us for one of the
   rehearsals with a  real vocal coach! *We've been enjoying an awesome
   opportunity to learn from a real vocal coach that has been showing up in
   our week night rehearsals for the past couple of months.  For those that
   want to learn how to sing, or for those that think they know how to sing
   (like me), show up to one or all of the remaining rehearsals from 7-9 PM on
   the following Mondays: Sept/28, Oct/26, Nov/16, and Dec/14.  Don't worry
   about showing up late or having to leave early.  Bring a friend if you'd
   like, it's starting to get cold and dark at night!

More formal announcements will be made but there's a sneak peek.

Now, on to Sunday and the song suggestions.

Officiant Scheduled: Ev. Murray
Organist: Sis. Schenk
Director: Br. Baisch
Bible verse: *If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. John 14: 14*


*Before:*

C631 The Lord’s Prayer (May be a stretch)

C734 Be strong in the Lord (We may know this one?)

1 All glory be to God on high v2

142 Thy will be done

*Opening Hymns*

*Opening:*

            H466 Holy Spirit

H247 Just as God leads me

H243 Have Thine own way, Lord

*After Text and During Service*

142 Thy will be done v.1

H84 I do not ask for earthly store v.3

C690 He Leadeth Me

*Repentance:* *Choir* 96 Hear Thou my prayer v. 4

*Communion:* H360 What joy ‘tis redeemed to be v.1+4

*After:* H408 Forth, forth, my heart, to heaven v.3+4


Thanks for reading this way too long email!

Jason
Hi Barb, I thought about that too and thought that his speech might be more
widely accepted if people have a chance to read and digest the information
on their own prior to the announcement.  Plus I'm sort of sneaking it in
along with the songs for Sunday so that it doesn't come as an out of
nowhere BIG, INTIMIDATING announcement.

Regarding songs for Thanksgiving and Christmas, I know that I am scheduled
to direct, but that doesn't mean I have to pick all the songs and/or direct
them all.  So if you guys have some suggestions, please do share.  Thanks
for the additional email addresses as well.  I'll be sure to add them.

Jon, I didn't see your original remarks to Barb about email invites for
rehearsals but I think its an excellent idea.  I just put reminders on my
Calendar today (finally) with all the rehearsals for Noel and also the days
I'm directing.  I think a reminder for the Choir to add to their Calendar
is an excellent reminder.  Anything put down on "paper" instantly has a
greater chance of being done.  I think the calendar invites/reminders alone
might help to boost attendance and participation.

And thanks Barb for allowing us the freedom to do, what we do.

J

Sounds good....I don't know if I will be ready for Monday but I will try to
find at least one.

Quickly, I am about to send the songs out to the Choir and was thinking of
incorporating the following...what do you think?

Hi Barb,

Just wondering if we would be able to utilize Noel during our Novemeber
16th and December 14th to help with Thanksgiving and Christmas songs if
necessary?  Just a forward thinking thought.

Hi Guys,

I have a last minute change of schedule which takes me out of church on
Sunday.  Can either of you direct in my place?  Let me know if you would
like me to pick songs...I would be happy to and I have time to do it.

Thanks,
Jason
What are you doing up at 3 in the morning party girl!?!

Hi guys, 
I didn't see songs for tomorrow which makes me nervous that I was on the schedule and forgot. I am in Chicago this weekend for work and don't have access to even pick songs. I am sorry for the lack of notice if I am indeed, on the schedule. I'll be happy to cover for the next 3 years...very sorry!!!
Jason

Sent from my iPhoneHi Jon, Sorry for the late notice but I wont make it in time for rehearsal

Hi Jon,

Subject: PLEASE, PLEASE REPLY - hopefully by NOON Saturday

Hi All - I got a text from Noel that he left his windbreaker at church
tonight.  I asked him if he wanted to pick it up at our next rehearsal, or
I'd meet him at church any time to get it, or whether we should hold it
hostage for him to come sing with us on Sunday.

His reply:

*"If everyone else will be there, I will come and sing on Sunday.  But only
if we have a run-through before the service.*
*Deal?"*

*Is everyone willing to come early - ready to sing at 9:40 am - to run
through the songs for service?*

Please let me know by noon on Saturday so I can get back to Noel one way or
another.

Thanks for your prompt response!
Barb

Subject: Re: Quartet for this Sunday - 10 April

Hi All - Sorry I have not gotten back to you.  Our sopranos will be absent
tomorrow!  So - if it will work out for you to come early, at 9:40 to
practice, we can see how it goes with me and/or Betsy on soprano.  If you
cannot make it, or it doesn't work out, I have another song that the choir
can sing after the text (#8 in the choir book - verse 2 of Give me a heart
like Thine).  Please reply to all to confirm that you got this message and
whether or not it will work out for you.  Thanks, so much for your
understanding and flexibility!  Barb

I've just started reading the DSG for the service - I haven't even gotten  
all the way through it - but this song jumped out at me. So I haven't yet  
put the list of songs together. I may want to use it for after the text.



And if it doesn't work out, or you're not comfortable doing this - please,  
please speak up. There are all kinds of other songs that can be sung with  
the choir in place of this.



Thanks!

HI Jon - Here's the songs for Sunday. Thanks, so very much for doing this!  
It is the 1st Sunday so there is rehearsal, as well.



For rehearsal could you please:

* Ask the Ev and DEv to please say hello in the back after the video and  
the discussion. That would really aid the rehearsal to get started sooner -  
especially as there is the video and the discussion this Sunday

* In rehearsal please review: Ave Verum Corpus; #128 in the choir book;  
Praise is Rising sheet music. And anything else you'd like to cover.

* Please let the choir know that the Mozart will not be sung until the 17th  
or 24th as Simone will not be in White Plains to play on the 10th.

* Remind the choir that our next rehearsal with Noel is Monday 25 April.



Thanks, again Jon! Have an amazing day in White Plains. Jason - enjoy the  
confirmation in New Milford!

Just so you know, we are in Philly this weekend for Easter. I'll look forward to listening to the recording if you do sing Ave Verum Corpus.

See you on Wednesday!

Subject: Re: Song suggestions for Easter Sunday - 27 March 2016

Hi All -

I'm so sorry that the flu has taken it's toll in White Plains.  I hope
everyone is feeling better soon!

With all the sickness, the Good Friday song list ended up with
last-minute-revamping.  We did more congregational singing and did NOT sing
Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus.

If it works out, and everyone is healthy and feels up to it, we will sing
the Mozart tomorrow for Easter for repentance.  Please note, this is NOT a
call for anyone to overextend themselves or hurt their voice or to try
anything super-heroic!  If it works out - that's a wonderful thing.  If it
does not work out, then we will sing it in the next couple of weeks - the
3rd or 10th of April.

Everyone - choir and organists alike - worked very, very hard on the
Passion Week songs.  And we sound very, very good.  It can be disappointing
when we've worked so hard on something and circumstances and plans change.
I want to assure everyone that we WILL sing the Mozart, either tomorrow or
in the next few weeks when it works out for everyone.  None of our
rehearsing is in vain, as we carry all our learning through to every song
that we sing.

And one more reminder - that EVERYONE is invited to sing in the choir -
whether it's once a month or once a year or every service!

Thanks, so much, for all you do!  Stay healthy!  💒
Barb

The original music is certainly out of copyright, and the Latin text is as  
well. The translation into English may or may not be depending on when it  
was done. You already saw an example of the Wikipedia translation which is  
out of copyright, but the are some like this one which are still in  
copyright. To display the words on the screen, we just need to make sure  
that the translation into English which we choose to display is in the  
public domain. From what I can tell, we should have a fair amount to choose  
from.



By the way, what I'm referencing is from the Visual Aid Guidelines (Page 11  
of the Spring 2015 Vision):

What Should Not Be Displayed:


Copyrighted lyrics (without permission to display them)



The lyrics to many songs, outside of hymns, are going to be copyrighted. In  
these cases, permission must be obtained from the copyright holder before  
the lyrics can be displayed. Note: just because a choir purchases sheet  
music for their choir members, this does not necessarily mean that the  
lyrics can be posted. Only if the lyrics are public domain can they be  
posted without permission.

Oh, sorry -- I looked up the translation because I wanted to know what we

the English words into the song, but I do like the idea of having the

Otherwise it is just pretty music without any real meaning.

Thanks, Jon - What is your opinion on singing it in Latin? It really isn't  
that hard to sing phonetically. I have a few different translations (thanks  
for supplying yours!) and any one of them would be a bit awkward "fitting"  
the English text to the music - but we can absolutely do it if we think  
it's the better way to go. I don't feel that the "Lead us Heavenly Father"  
words are nearly as appropriate for passion week. Thanks! Barb

Good Morning Barb,



My preference is the Vicky Tucker Courtney arrangement. Regarding Ave Verum  
Copus, I found the words on Wikipedia here:



Latin English



Ave verum corpus, natum
de Maria Virgine, [2]
vere passum, immolatum
in cruce pro homine
cuius latus perforatum
fluxit aqua et sanguine: [3]
esto nobis praegustatum
in mortis examine. [4]

O Iesu dulcis, O Iesu pie,
O Iesu, fili Mariae.
Miserere mei. Amen. [5]


Hail, true Body, born
of the Virgin Mary,
who having truly suffered, was sacrificed
on the cross for mankind,
whose pierced side
flowed with water and blood:
May it be for us a foretaste [of the Heavenly banquet]
in the trial of death.

O sweet Jesus, O holy Jesus,
O Jesus, son of Mary,
have mercy on me. Amen.




Of course the song is beautiful, and the words seem fitting for Good Friday.



Thanks!

Hi all - I'm looking for your input, please.


Palm Sunday is always a difficult service to find songs for because the  
focus of Passion week is Good Friday and Easter.


So I've been searching for contemporary "Hosanna" songs and I've found one  
that I'd like your opinion on.


PLEASE disregard the way the song is sung - very "sweet" and "cute" - and  
really unlike what Noel is teaching us.


The recordings have full orchestration and we would do them with just a  
piano accompaniment.


The first is a shorter version and sung very "choral-y". The second is sung  
in a style more in line with the lyrics (though both still sound "sweet!"),  
and is quite long, and I'd likely cut some of it out.


Again, please let me know your thoughts. Click on (or cut and paste) each  
link, then click on the "LISTEN" button.


Version 1: (Vicky Tucker Courtney arrangement)

http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/hosanna-praise-is-rising-sheet-music/19831527


Version 2: (Richard Kingsmore arrangement):

http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/hosanna-praise-is-rising-sheet-music/16557262

And if you have any other suggestions for Palm Sunday songs - I'm all ears!  
I'm looking at a few different versions of Holy! Holy! Holy!


For Good Friday it is very likely we will do Mozart's "Ave Verum Copus"  
(we've sung it as "Lead Us Heavenly Father"). What are your thoughts about  
singing it in Latin and displaying an English version of the words (which  
are NOT "Lead us Heavenly Father!") on the monitor? It is a classical piece  
written in Latin - but is singing it in Latin too Catholic for us at this  
time?


Thanks,

Barb

hi jon - unfortunately i have a fever, chills & am achey so i won't be  
there this morning. can some else pls play the organ for repentance &  
communion? i was looking at

repentance: 11 God the all powerful
communion: 75 blessed assurance

will this be recorded or can i watch it from home?

thx - i'll also txt. barb


Thanks Barb! Will do. From her email, I don't think Heidi has issues with  
singing, but if I remember correctly, the two things she seemed to have a  
problem with were (1) seeing the director in the new location when she was  
playing something complicated on the left page and (2) having time to have  
all her songs pre-set (instead of just the next one). I wonder if there are  
things we can do to help those issues while still accomplishing what we  
want to accomplish (I know this is what what we were all trying to  
brainstorm in the meeting). For point 1, The mirror idea seemed the most  
promising. For point 2, I wonder: Are there members who are willing to be  
organist's assistants who could setup the books in advance? Or maybe we  
could as choir directors as a way of "washing the disciples' feet." (I've  
finally figured out how to get to church by 9:30 on Sunday's even with kids  
and Hank). I don't know -- I'm thinking of what the Bishop said on Sunday  
when he lamented "We're so human, aren't we?" I'm also thinking about that  
song "There were 99 that safely lay...". There must be something we can do.  
I understand people retiring from the choir because they have gotten older,  
but Heidi isn't at that point yet. I feel like she is just in a ditch and  
needs a helping hand so she can have peace.



Anyway, I'm rambling. Let's talk more tomorrow night once I get home from  
church (generally a little after 10).



Thanks!

~Jon

hi jon - thanks for the heads up. i appreciate it. i have rehearsal tonight  
and won't be home until after 11. so if you want to chat it will have to be  
really late or we can talk tomorrow after group discussion. ( or once  
you're home so we don't have to keep grace and the boys waiting). in the  
meantime can you pls confirm with heidi that she does indeed want to stop  
playing and then take a look at reworking the schedule - again! pls also  
let her know that the new liturgy is here for the foreseeable future and  
that she's welcome back as an organist and/or choir member at any time.  
thanks! barb

Dear Barb,



I wanted to give you this as a head's up. I remember the sound in Heidi's  
voice on Sunday and I think this was just the "straw that broke the camel's  
back." Do you have time to talk sometime tonight? If so, let me know what  
works for you.

Good morning Jon - I know this will "upset the apple cart", but I have come  
to the
decision that I no longer find joy in being an organist. I've been  
struggling with this
for a while, Sundays' meeting kind of "clinched the deal", then that  
afternoon my
mother was hospitalized again. I come to service to find peace, not to find  
more
stress which is already a steady thing in my life. I miss the way things  
used to be.
Heidi


Hey Barb,



I looked over your changes and had a couple concerns:



Betsy has requested just Wednesday nights
Kathy has requested just once a month.


Could you verify with them that they are okay with deviating from this?



Thanks!

~Jon

Hey Barb,



Sounds good -- Simone has confirmed that she is available to play on  
Sunday. I had originally put you on for the 17th, but because it is a  
webcast, you'd only be responsible for repentance and communion songs, so I  
moved you to the 31st, and then you're out on the 24th. But yeah, if you  
don't mind the late notice for Sunday, then go for it!



I've included my master excel spreadsheet which includes the vacation  
information. Feel free to make whatever changes you see necessary. Also, I  
only put myself on the schedule for Sunday because I felt bad for asking  
anyone else to pick songs so late (I meant to talk to you on Wednesday).  
When you re-shuffle, please don't feel like you need to find me another  
spot to direct.



Thanks!

Thanks, Jon. I'm re-working the schedule now, which will need to be checked  
against your "availability" list. I'd like to direct this Sunday because I  
can't wait until the 31st to do my first directing. I'll get back to you  
with the re-scheduled list hopefully tonight. Thanks! Barb

we will still rehearsl.

Hey Barb,



I just noticed that we have practice scheduled during this time. Is your  
plan to cancel practice? Or will Jason cover practice?

Good Evening All,


The 29th of November will not work for our next leadership team meeting due  
to prior planned activities.


As a result I would like to try to have this meeting after service on  
Sunday, Dec. 6th right after service.


Can you all confirm back to me?


Many Thanks, Chris

Jeff,


Two things.


The verse for tonight for the service is 1 John 1:6. Also, you cc'd my  
Philips work address. Please delete that from your contacts as that's not

Hi Barb,

I will not be there tonight. I've taken off from work today and am celebrating Luke's Birthday. If you send me the recording, I'll put it up.

Subject: Re: Rehearsal is Monday with Noel instead of Sunday after service

Hey Jason - There's actually 4 different songs in the Celebration hymnal
using that same Haydn melody.  We've never used them because they are the
same as (and excuse my spelling here) "Duetchland, Duetchland Uber Alles" -
used by the Germans during Hitler's time.  When we first got the
Celebration hymnal and I was going to practice one of them maybe 7 or so
years ago, Simone was pretty upset.

Things and attitudes may have changed since then.  So would you please
reach out to Simone and get her take on it?  See if she's OK with it?  If
not, then I would HIGHLY advise against using it.

Thanks!  Barb

Hi Deacon Strobel,



I'd like to order the following wireless HDMI for the TV upstairs:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00630WKGI?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=as2&creative=374929&camp=211189



The cost with tax will be $196.73. This should allow Joachim to put  
powerpoint presentations of the text word and songs on the TV, as well as  
any other reference text words during service.



I will be measuring the stretch from the sacristy to the TV (through the  
attic) -- If the wireless solution doesn't work, the wired solution I found  
costs $315 (provided the distance is <= 100 ft), but it is out of stock for  
the next 6 months. My hope is that the wireless option will work for us.  
Let me know what you think.



Thanks!

~Jon

Hi all,



You wont want to miss this service! Here are the songs suggestions for  
Sunday.


Open: H45 Let us sing with joyful voices

Open: H120 Arise and let us hasten


Before:

31 I know of a dear little chapel v1-3

153 Singing with grace to the Lord v1,3

88 True hearted, whole hearted v1-3

241 AT the living altar



During:

Text 59 On rock that stands forever

COB H147 Pass it on v3

COB C605 Living for Jesus v1,4 NEW


Repentance: H308 Whosoever heareth v3

Communion: H267 A Sparkling Stream

Close: H278 For you I am praying 2,4



Hey Jason,



Our practice on Sunday is actually after service (and will just be to  
figure out when to hold practices), so we won't have a chance to practice  
Living for Jesus. It's a pretty song though.



Thanks!

Hi Victor,



We are in the process of getting a TV for the White Plains Congregation.  
Pr. Slade mentioned that you handled the technical side of a similar  
project for your congregation. He mentioned that you used a USB stick to  
get the presentation to the TV. I've researched it a little, and I have a  
question for you:



 From what I can tell, you have to convert the PowerPoint to a movie file,  
and then run the movie file off the USB. Does that effectively mean that  
you can post one slide for the whole service? I just want to make sure  
we're not missing anything. Frankly having the text word and songs posted  
would be useful, but if it is possible, I'd like to be able to have several  
slides displayed. Alternatively, are you able to create a movie file per  
slide, and then just view the next movie when it comes time to switch?



I'd appreciate any insight you have.



Thanks!

~Jon

Hey Jason,

Sorry for such a short email. I was celebrating a friend's birthday and  
hadn't been checking my phone. I saw your email while we were driving home  
and I had Grace write you a quick response so you'd have at least some time  
to work on the songs. Let me know if you need the schedule again. If be

Hehe - There was a song I felt was slow, but I don't remember which one. I  
didn't realize it was so obvious in my expression. I will say that I'm  
thoroughly enjoying singing tenor now that I can sing without using  
falsetto.

Jon - I'm in Rochester and will not be able to direct. Will you be able to  
jump in for me? I picked out songs and sent them out to the choir members a  
few minutes ago. Heidi is scheduled to play and I do not know her situation  
currently as to whether or not she will be able to make it to service. If  
you are feeling brave, you can also add #264 "If God be for us" to the list  
for this morning. We have not sung it in a long time and will not be having  
rehearsal to run through it. So it is entirely up to you. And please feel  
free to swap out any songs that do not resonate with you for this service.


I hope you all have an amazing time with Bishop Schmidt!

Please excuse me for not notifying you that I would probably not make it  
tonight - I did call Barb earlier in the week to cover for me since I knew  
I might be delayed.

My apologies-

We will be away for the weekend so will see you next week.

Thanks

To: jonathan.jawhite@gmail.com <jonathan.jawhite@gmail.com>




Amazon Echo




Prime members can now ask Echo to play hundreds of ad-free, personalized  
streaming music stations. Like, dislike, or skip as many songs as you wish  
while you discover songs from the Prime Music catalog. With Prime Stations,  
the more you listen and rate songs, the more personalized each station  
becomes.

Get started today with the following requests:


Play a Prime Station by saying "Alexa, play the Bruno Mars Prime Station."
Control playback with "Alexa, next", "Alexa, pause/resume", or "Alexa, go  
back."
Learn about what's playing by asking "Alexa, what song is this?"
Personalize your stations by saying "Alexa, thumbs up/thumbs down."


Also, because so many of you were interested in IFTTT, we'd like to share  
some great recipes Echo customers created which can control a Nest  
thermostat, add Shopping List items to an iOS Reminders list, or even have  
Echo send an e-mail. Since last Friday, Echo customers have created 10,000  
recipes and shared over 100. If you haven't used IFTTT yet, sign up here,  
activate the Amazon Alexa channel, and try any of the shared recipes.  
Thanks to everyone who has created and shared their recipes!

As always, the Amazon Echo team looks forward to your feedback via the  
Amazon Echo App and on social media (#AmazonEcho).

right time and do the right thing at the right time. I am bold to declare  
what I want and confidently reject what I dislike. My path is laced with

whatever I need - resources, materials, information - everything...in my  
God's name"
