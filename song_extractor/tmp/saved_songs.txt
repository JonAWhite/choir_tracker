Hi Everyone,

I just heard from Evangelist that Service has been cancelled for tomorrow.
Have a safe weekend!

Yes, die hard singers, you can still start sininging at 10:15 tomorrow
morning from the comfort of your own home.  Keep in mind, we were going to
sing "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" using the traditional kids
melody, not the one printed in the book.  Hope all goes well!

Jason

Hi Barb,
No problem, I'll send the note out.  Do you think we can go over C796
quickly on Monday?  It's a "familiar" tune but I don't believe anyone has
sung it before.
Thanks,
Jason

We've been enjoying an awesome opportunity to learn from a real vocal coach that has been showing up in our week night rehearsals for the past couple of months.

Dear Choir,

Thank you all for your efforts last week, singing and rehearsing.  For
those that were not able to stay for the rehearsal, it was very
constructive and here are some of the highlights:

   - *Future rehearsals will be held after service for approx. 30 minutes
   on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.*  That means no rehearsal this
   Sunday and no more early mornings!  Sleep in, enjoy your coffee (w/o milk
   per Barb's instruction), and eat some breakfast!
   - *Attending rehearsal is not mandatory in order to sing in the choir or
   to "sing that day"!*  I know some of us are still under this
   impression.  Obviously, as the "directors",  we encourage you to attend
   because this is when we get to learn and practice the cool new songs with
   the awesome words...but it's no longer mandatory (and hasn't been for
   sometime).  If you happen to get caught in the choir, and you don't know a
   song, just fake it till you make it!
   - *Please extend the invitation to all of those that would like to sing.
    *Whether you'd like to sing every service, once in a while, or when
   you're in the mood; just show up.  Black and White is not required (but
   Mary and Jon are)!  If you only have time for a special song once in a
   while, share this with one of the directors (Barb, D. White, or myself) and
   we will be more than happy to schedule you in!
   - *If you REALLY want to learn how to sing, join us for one of the
   rehearsals with a  real vocal coach! *We've been enjoying an awesome
   opportunity to learn from a real vocal coach that has been showing up in
   our week night rehearsals for the past couple of months.  For those that
   want to learn how to sing, or for those that think they know how to sing
   (like me), show up to one or all of the remaining rehearsals from 7-9 PM on
   the following Mondays: Sept/28, Oct/26, Nov/16, and Dec/14.  Don't worry
   about showing up late or having to leave early.  Bring a friend if you'd
   like, it's starting to get cold and dark at night!

More formal announcements will be made but there's a sneak peek.

Now, on to Sunday and the song suggestions.

Officiant Scheduled: Ev. Murray
Organist: Sis. Schenk
Director: Br. Baisch
Bible verse: *If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. John 14: 14*


*Before:*

C631 The Lordâ€™s Prayer (May be a stretch)

C734 Be strong in the Lord (We may know this one?)

1 All glory be to God on high v2

142 Thy will be done

*Opening Hymns*

*Opening:*

            H466 Holy Spirit

H247 Just as God leads me

H243 Have Thine own way, Lord

*After Text and During Service*

142 Thy will be done v.1

H84 I do not ask for earthly store v.3

C690 He Leadeth Me

*Repentance:* *Choir* 96 Hear Thou my prayer v. 4

*Communion:* H360 What joy â€˜tis redeemed to be v.1+4

*After:* H408 Forth, forth, my heart, to heaven v.3+4


Thanks for reading this way too long email!

Jason
Hi Barb, I thought about that too and thought that his speech might be more
widely accepted if people have a chance to read and digest the information
on their own prior to the announcement.  Plus I'm sort of sneaking it in
along with the songs for Sunday so that it doesn't come as an out of
nowhere BIG, INTIMIDATING announcement.

Regarding songs for Thanksgiving and Christmas, I know that I am scheduled
to direct, but that doesn't mean I have to pick all the songs and/or direct
them all.  So if you guys have some suggestions, please do share.  Thanks
for the additional email addresses as well.  I'll be sure to add them.

Jon, I didn't see your original remarks to Barb about email invites for
rehearsals but I think its an excellent idea.  I just put reminders on my
Calendar today (finally) with all the rehearsals for Noel and also the days
I'm directing.  I think a reminder for the Choir to add to their Calendar
is an excellent reminder.  Anything put down on "paper" instantly has a
greater chance of being done.  I think the calendar invites/reminders alone
might help to boost attendance and participation.

And thanks Barb for allowing us the freedom to do, what we do.

J
