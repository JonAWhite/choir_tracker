Hi Everyone,

I just heard from Evangelist that Service has been cancelled for tomorrow.
Have a safe weekend!

Yes, die hard singers, you can still start sininging at 10:15 tomorrow
morning from the comfort of your own home.  Keep in mind, we were going to
sing "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" using the traditional kids
melody, not the one printed in the book.  Hope all goes well!

Jason
